Why use a hosts file for fediblock?
Blocking the dns for all instances/sites that you don't want want to federate with is a sort of nuclear option, preventing any commination to any domain on the list. meaning that your instance can't pull **any**: user, post or instance information from all domains on the list.
It also works on any type fedi instance: mastodon, misskey, peertube, pixelfed, gotosocail, etc despite their built in moderation tools.
